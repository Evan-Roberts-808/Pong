## Overview
This project is my submission for the Weekly Coding Challenge #36, where the goal was to build a simple version of the classic game Pong. Pong is a table tennis-themed game released by Atari in 1972 and is considered one of the first commercially successful computer games.

## Getting Started
To run the Pong game on your local machine, follow these steps:
instructions to come once complete
<!-- 1. Choose your preferred programming language and development environment.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Pygame for Python).
4. Run the main game file. -->

## Features
- Interactive Pong game featuring both single player against ai and two player.
- Randomized ball movement and collisions.
