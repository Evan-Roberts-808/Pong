## Overview
This project is my submission for the Weekly Coding Challenge #36, where the goal was to build a simple version of the classic game Pong. Pong is a table tennis-themed game released by Atari in 1972 and is considered one of the first commercially successful computer games.

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

To run the Pong game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. In your terminal, run the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:Evan-Roberts-808/Pong.git
```

2. Navigate to the "Game" directory:
```
cd your/path/to/Pong/Game
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the game using the following command:
```
python menu.py
```

### Running the Executable

1. Follow the directions above to clone the repo, or click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP". If necessary, unzip the downloaded file.

2. In your file explorer, open the Project folder, and navigate into the nested Pong folder.

3. Run the Pong.exe executable to play the game.

<b>Note:</b> Due to it not being a widely distributed executable, your anti virus may stop to scan the file before the game can be launched.

## Features
- Interactive Pong Gameplay: Enjoy a classic Pong experience with both single-player mode against AI and a thrilling two-player mode for competitive matches.

## Technologies used

- Python: The game is primarily developed using Python, a versatile and powerful programming language.

- Pygame: a cross-platform set of Python modules, is employed for creating the game's graphical interface and managing various aspects of the game, such as drawing elements and handling user input.

- Neat-Python: The NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, implemented through neat-python, is utilized for AI opponent training and decision-making.
